PostgreMote:
  ✔ configure jest and wallaby @done
  ☐ implement an SQL-like DSL @started
    ☐ test escaping and sql injection prevention
  ☐ implement a simple server that converts an SQL-like DSL received over some sort of protocol and then makes a request to the database
  ☐ implement a tool that generates TypeScript code for PostgreSQL stored functions and tables from the chosen scheme
  ☐ implement database migration tool for PostgreMote with auto code generation
  ☐ implement database testing tool PostgreMote with all the generated types used so we could make a static analysis over the tests
